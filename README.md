# MusicStyleTransfer

Represent one style of music to another!

Observing the success of neural nets in other fields we aim to produce interesting results from music . Music is fundamentally a sequence of notes. A composer constructs long sequences of notes which are then performed through an instrument to produce music. Humans can easily identify the genre of a music by just listening to it .However it is quite difficult to parametrize the style of music as it is not dependent on any fixed metric such as pitch,vocal etc but depends on its composition and performance which need to be correlated. Although the genre of music (Classical , Jazz etc  )depends on the listener, there are certain distinguishing characteristics of each genre. Generative models can be applied to change properties of existing data in a principled way, even transfer properties between data samples.In this report we will aim to understand the styles of the different music genres and transform one style of music to another through transfer of properties. We show a comparison between various approaches and the resulting musical pieces by means of Generative Adversarial networks (GANs) and Sequence - Sequence Model(Seq-Seq).
